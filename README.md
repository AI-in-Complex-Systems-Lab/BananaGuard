Use main.py for the website interface.

Download yolov10.pt, yolov11.pt, detr and yolov10n.pt (the base models).

Due to the large size of the RT-DETR model, I was unable to upload it to GitHub.

All models are available on the Google Drive: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1K4e9r0Ryq1CJDzhHjC4GjF19xoZJES9r?usp=sharing

Please update the file paths for these models.
